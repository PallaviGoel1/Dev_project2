                    <li>This is the game for 2 players. Each player will roll a dice one after another 
                        and will move the counter on board accordingly.</li> 

                    <li>At your turn, roll the dice and you will move forward your conter by same number of boxes on the 
                        board in numeric order as appeared on dice.</li>

                    <li>The game's ladders will help you move upwards and go faster. If you reach precisely the number 
                        where the bottom of the ladder shows, then you can move your counter to the top of ladder. But 
                        if you get to the top of the ladder, you don't have to go down. Just stay there and follow the game. 
                        Also you can't climb from the middle of a ladder.</li>

                    <li>The snakes in the game brings you down. If you reach precisely the number where the head of the snake 
                        shows, you have to move your counter to the tale of the snake. But if you get to the bottom or 
                        middle of the snake, you don't have to go down. Just stay there and follow the game.</li>

                    <li>Player will need exact number to reach 100. If, with the number on dice, player can go beyond 100, 
                        player shouldn't move the counter and his turn will be cancelled.</li>
